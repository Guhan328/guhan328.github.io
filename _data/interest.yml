  My research mostly focuses on the deployment challenges of AI-driven communication techniques in future dynamic networks.
  
  #- **Cross-modal representation learning** for joint understanding of text and images
  #- **Interpretable AI models** with explainable decision-making processes
  #- **Efficient learning algorithms** for low-resource scenarios
  
  #I'm particularly interested in applications that can benefit society, such as healthcare 
  #diagnostics and educational technologies.
