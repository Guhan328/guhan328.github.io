#    There are various patterns of a bicolour cat. These range from the Van-patterned (colour on the crown of the head 
#    and the tail only) to a solid colour with a throat locket or medallion. Bicolour coats are found in many cat breeds, 
#    as well as being common in domestic longhair and domestic shorthair cats.
